Till now, we knew how to create 1 user (which came by default or made via application properties)

But when we want many users, say need users from DB table, we have to use User MAnager interface, which not only create those users but also provide them methods.

create/update/delete user
get username 
get password
get authorities
load user by username
change password etc.

JDBC User Details Manager is used in configuration, db is defined in app.properties
