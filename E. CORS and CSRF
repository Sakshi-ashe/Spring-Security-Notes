CSRF( Cross site request forgery)

Let's say you login to netflix, your auth token is stored as cookies in browser. If you go to a malicious site it can take the netflix cookie and create any HTTP request to netflix 
on your behalf. This is prevented by using CSRF token which is not kept in browser cookie. and other sites thus cannot use cookie in browser alone to make a request on your behalf
they need CSRF token too, otherwise it would be a invalid request.

To do : where is CSRF token stored client side?
